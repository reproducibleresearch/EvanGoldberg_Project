In May 2020, the Georgia Department of Public Health posted the following plot to illustrate the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in their hardest-hit counties over a two-week period. Health officials claimed that the plot provided evidence that COVID-19 cases were decreasing and made the argument for reopening the state.

The plot was heavily criticized by the statistical community and several media outlets for its deceptive portrayal of COVID-19 trends in Georgia. Whether the end result was due to malicious intent or simply poor judgment, it is incredibly irresponsible to publish data visualizations that obscure and distort the truth. 

Data visualization is an incredibly powerful tool that can affect health policy decisions. Ensuring they are easy to interpret, and more importantly, showcase accurate insights from data is paramount for scientific transparency and the health of individuals. For this assignment you are tasked with reproducing COVID-19 visualizations and tables published by the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html).
Specifically, you will attempt to reproduce the following for January 17th, 2021:

1. New cases as a function of time with a rolling average plot - the first plot on the page (you don't need to recreate the colors or theme)
2. Table of cases, hospitalizations and deaths - the first table on the page
3. The county-level map for previous week ('Hot spots') - the second plot on the page (only the 'Hot Spots' plot)
4. Table of cases by state - the second table on the page (do not need to include per 100,000 or per capita columns)

Data for cases and deaths can be downloaded from this [NYT GitHub repository](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data) (use `us-counties.csv`). Data for hospitalizations can be downloaded from [The COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/data). The project must be submitted in the form of a Jupyter notebook or RMarkdown file and corresponding compiled/knitted PDF, with commented code and text interspersed, including a **brief critique of the reproducibility of each plot and table**. All project documents must be uploaded to a GitHub repository each student will create within the [reproducible data science organization](https://github.com/reproducibleresearch). The repository must also include a README file describing the contents of the repository and how to reproduce all results. You should keep in mind the file and folder structure we covered in class and make the reproducible process as automated as possible.
