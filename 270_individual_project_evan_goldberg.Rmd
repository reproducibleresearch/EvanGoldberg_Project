In May 2020, the Georgia Department of Public Health posted the following plot to illustrate the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in their hardest-hit counties over a two-week period. Health officials claimed that the plot provided evidence that COVID-19 cases were decreasing and made the argument for reopening the state.

The plot was heavily criticized by the statistical community and several media outlets for its deceptive portrayal of COVID-19 trends in Georgia. Whether the end result was due to malicious intent or simply poor judgment, it is incredibly irresponsible to publish data visualizations that obscure and distort the truth. 

Data visualization is an incredibly powerful tool that can affect health policy decisions. Ensuring they are easy to interpret, and more importantly, showcase accurate insights from data is paramount for scientific transparency and the health of individuals. For this assignment you are tasked with reproducing COVID-19 visualizations and tables published by the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html).
Specifically, you will attempt to reproduce the following for January 17th, 2021:

1. New cases as a function of time with a rolling average plot - the first plot on the page (you don't need to recreate the colors or theme)
2. Table of cases, hospitalizations and deaths - the first table on the page
3. The county-level map for previous week ('Hot spots') - the second plot on the page (only the 'Hot Spots' plot)
4. Table of cases by state - the second table on the page (do not need to include per 100,000 or per capita columns)

Data for cases and deaths can be downloaded from this [NYT GitHub repository](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data) (use `us-counties.csv`). Data for hospitalizations can be downloaded from [The COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/data). The project must be submitted in the form of a Jupyter notebook or RMarkdown file and corresponding compiled/knitted PDF, with commented code and text interspersed, including a **brief critique of the reproducibility of each plot and table**. All project documents must be uploaded to a GitHub repository each student will create within the [reproducible data science organization](https://github.com/reproducibleresearch). The repository must also include a README file describing the contents of the repository and how to reproduce all results. You should keep in mind the file and folder structure we covered in class and make the reproducible process as automated as possible.

#create a column for new cases by subtracting the previous day's total number

#create a rolling 7 day average which is the average number of new cases over

#drop rows before March 1st

1. New cases as a function of time with a rolling average plot - the first plot on the page (you don't need to recreate the colors or theme)

```{r}
ggplot(cases_per_day)+

           color = "salmon", 
           alpha = 0.75, 
           width = 0.01)+
  geom_line(aes(x = date, y= new_cases_7dayavg), 
            color = "darkred")+ #creates the line for 7-day average
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 month", 
               date_labels = "%b-%Y")+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(0, 100000, 200000, 300000), 
                     labels = c("0", "100,000", "200,000", "300,000"))+
  xlab("Date")+
  ylab("Cases")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 6))+
  #create labels to differentiate the columns and line plots
  geom_text(
    label="7-day average", 
    x=as.Date("2020-07-25"),
    y=100000,
    size = 3
    )+
  geom_segment(aes(x = as.Date("2020-07-25"), 
                   y = 66000, 
                   xend = as.Date("2020-07-25"), 
                   yend = 92000), 
               size = 0.2)+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 6))+
  geom_text(
    label="New cases", 
    x=as.Date("2020-12-01"),
    y=300000,
    size = 3
    )+
  geom_segment(aes(x = as.Date("2020-12-25"), 
                   y = 300000, 
                   xend = as.Date("2021-01-08"), 
                   yend = 300000), 
               size = 0.2)+
  ggtitle("Coronavirus in the U.S.: Case Count")
```

This figure was fairly easy to reproduce, however there were some aspects of the original figure that are not explained very well. Specifically how they derived their data for the first week of 7 day averages is not super clear. They do not explain whether they use data from prior dates that are not shown, or whether they derive the values differently for the first week. Simply using data from the last week of February yields values slightly below their values, however it does not appear to be significantly different, and thus, does not drastically change our understanding of the figure. Overall I would say this figure does have fairly good reproducability.
